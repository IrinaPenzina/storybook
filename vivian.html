        <h3>Dream NeVIgation</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
        Interesting childhood it was for me to be part of a family headed by a pastor, managed by a wife who is naturally cut out for business, and guess what the standing order for the children was? Education! Education!! Education!!! I was well cared for in a very traditional and almost strict environment with limited access to going out to play and what kept myself and siblings busy was watching cartoon and solving puzzles (barbie princess and mickey mouse). Whereas they were interested in who wins the puzzle competition and what happens next in the cartoons. I was fascinated and intrigued by the colour combinations, arrangements and pose of characters and the moving aminative effects that came with what I was seeing. I immediately developed a savings culture so I could get more barbie-like puzzles to feed my eyes yeast. <br>
        <br>
        Not before long, I was the clothing advisor in my little castle. I started by choosing matching clothes for my siblings and in a small way I became the costumier of my family. Not long did my peers embraced this unique talent of mine which was a big booster for me in thinking about a career in the fashion space. On completing high school, my sense and knowledge for fashion and decoration became so obvious and endeared me to a lot of fashion lovers, who will give me money to shop for them, but there was this seemingly impossible hurdle I had to jump over because deep within me was a person wanting to set loose to realise her dreams of becoming an outstanding channel and voice in the fashion and decorative space.<br>
        <br>
        My parents have always wanted me to be a medical doctor. My elder brother was an agricultural scientist (you will understand “was” soon) who did his further studies in South Africa with my elder sister completing her masters in Procurement and Supply Chain Management and a charter with CIPS in the UK. Here I found myself in China studying medicine and surgery to be trained as a medical doctor, but my inner woman was craving for fashion. A turning point in my life that spurred me to jump of that seemingly impossible hurdle was when my elder brother, a gifted pianist and music instructor decided to follow and pursue music as a career in the stead of agriculture. <i>Holala…. There I go.</i> Away from home was away from sight and because I have always had an affinity for colours, particularly blending primary colours in to multifaceted colours I had to start something. So, from choosing matching clothes and suggesting designs for people came alive the budding of the dream of becoming a fashion designer.<br>
        <br>
        Although I have never received any formal or practical based education or training on fashion designing and tailoring. After realising that I had the talent for fashion, I begun a journey of personal studies via YouTube. I have YouTube to thank for most of the skills in cutting and alignment I know today. YouTube is one of the inevitable resource for learning that most people underestimate. Whatever you want to learn in this 21st century digital age is possible due to the diversity and variety of resources available on the internet. So, this hobby turned into self-study was critical in developing my skills into birthing my own fashion line <strong> NeVI - Nana. Ephya. Vivian. Impressions</strong>. <br>
        <br>
        NeVI designs and clothing arena is an all-inclusive store for customized, non-replicated, makeovers and stand-out African, Western and Chinese designs for every occasion ranging from dinner exclusives, heart-warming summer wears to first date attractions. <br>
        <br>
        I am proud of myself. Every day I work hard and look where I am now - I have my own fashion brand with clients based in China, UK, USA, Europe, and Africa. Almost the whole world! Can you imagine that?! However, I promise it's just a beginning...
