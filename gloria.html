          <h3>Who am I</h3>
          <!-- <br> -->
          <p>
            How dear does the clock not stop to acknowledge my happiness.my thoughts when I experienced success/joy. How dear does this life expect me to rise up to the occasion of life when it has beaten me flat on the ground? My thoughts as I experienced failure/ pain. Well life keeps demanding and the clock will never stop me. Then who am I exactly in this life? <br>
            Saturday Morning, 10 am, all my house chores nearly done, I hear Moipone! Moipone! (Oh that's my African name). The 8 year old me quickly squeezed the dish cloth and threw it in the sink rush outside to (Refilwe) meet my best friend, my neighbor to go play. Within an hour of our play time a silly comparison emerged. I went my mum bought me a watch, she went my mum bought me a dress, with the aim to overcome each other it got so heated that she ended up saying, you can brag all you want, but that woman that keeps buying you new stuff is not your mother, without thinking she said it: Your mum is dead!!!! For a while there was a pause but literally my life paused. By the end of the day I gave myself a new name "Orphaned".<br>
            Pondering on the "Your mum is dead!!!!". Suddenly this woman's (my grandmother) continues statement and I quote(" I will die one day and you need to be able to take care of yourself” now make lot of sense. My grandmother did pass away when I was aged 15. My survival instincts that have always been there grew to a giant. My survival instincts became the fuel to my ambition to succeed. I had to succeed and I did. I became a Civil Engineer specializing in Traffic and Transportation Engineering and I got married.<br>
            However, these survival instincts carried pain that came with the name "orphaned". Like a dormant volcano this pain brewed for years to the point of aggressive eruption. Showing up as anger and fear. The spillage of this anger and fear burned my marriage to ashes and turned the one thing that was always my refuge, my career, into a bed of thrones.<br>
            One: the story of pain, Two: the story of success, which may be labeled as failure and success, created profound confusions. Neither failure nor success answered to who I am. The Journey within brought a profound insight.<br>
            It became apparent these survival tactics will not carry me to the next chapter of my life. I became courageous and accepted the changes in my life. I became my own Superhero. The beginning of self-discovery emerged. As I allowed the healing process to happen by adding forgiveness to the equation and learning the art of letting go. One particular night laying on my back facing the roof a light in a form of words transcended to me and said "It's a script!!!!!!" It's a story!!!!! It's a script that I have been carrying for years. A script I didn't not have answers to.<br>
            Well, my Script was, against my mother, why did she leave me? How can she leave me? I invite you to forget “the script”/ “the story” for a moment. When our mother’s held us for the first time in their arms, there is no script nor a story it’s just a feeling, a feeling, even words cannot bring justice, aiming to define this feeling. It's a feeling of gratitude and endless possibilities. So, who am I? I am you and you are me born of the same feeling. What makes us different is nothing but the script. If we care enough to see each other without the script nor the story. We will serve each other at our greatest.<br>
