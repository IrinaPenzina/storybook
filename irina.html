        <h3>Fashion lover</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          I was obsessed with clothes from early childhood. I still remember one of my dreams from when I was about four. A big scary, and evil dragon tried to take the white collar – with two red cherries – from my red dress! We fought a real fight, pulling and pulling, but lucky me, I won! It was a very special dress. My mom had just bought it for me that day and I was afraid that something would happen to it.<br>
          As I grew up, I faced several fashion disasters. One of them was when I may have been three years old. My grandma took my sisters and I to my elder sister’s New Year celebration in the kindergarten. The night before my mom had sewn tinsel to our white dresses so we could be snowflakes for the costume party. I was so excited to shine among all the older kids. Imagine though, Russia, winter, December – it’s really cold. We were dressed up like little astronauts to get to the event. As we got there my grandma forgot to take off my warm pants covering my beautiful tights. I cried for the entire event. There were others catastrophes too, like when I was in middle school, I hated my ugly old winter coat.  I had to wear it every day. One day I heard some boys behind me making fun of me and laughing very loudly. It still feels like a nightmare.<br>
          I love fashion. I truly cannot understand how one cannot take pleasure in dressing up and looking amazing. Now, after I’ve realized I do not have to prove anything to anyone I can proudly say it out loud. For a long time, I was afraid to admit it. I was afraid to be that kind of girl. I was afraid that people would think I am stupid. I worked hard to escape that image: I got my master’s with honors, I worked for the government as a press secretary, and a PR manager for various corporations. I never could shake off my immense love for fashion though.<br>
          My obsession steered me towards learning anything and everything about fashion, or something around it. I watch lots and lots of fashion shows, I read fashion magazines, books and online sources, I see dozens of pictures and videos every day. Also, I have a place where I can share my knowledge, I teach International Fashion at MoD ‘Art institute in Shanghai.<br>
          As I found a way to express my passion, I immediately felt that I wanted more. I decided to build this website where I can share my vison of beauty and fashion. But what is a cover without content? Pictures alone cannot reflect the beauty I see in people. The stories they tell will reveal their true beauty.
