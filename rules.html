          <h3>Rules I follow</h3>
          <br> 
          <p>
            Do not play games. Be honest with yourself and the people around you.
            <br>
            <br>
            A human being is imperfect. Embrace it. Embrace the human being in you. Embrace yourself.
            <br>
            <br>
            Forgive yourself for all the suffering you caused to yourself and the people around you.
            <br>
            <br>
            Forgive people around you for all the suffering they caused you.
            <br>
            <br>
            You are not better or worse than others. Every person has a god inside. Every person is a universe. You should respect them despite their age or social status.
            <br>
            <br>
            Love yourself unconditionally. By loving the imperfect human being in you, you can fall in love with all people and the whole world in its amazing diversity.
            <br>
            <br>
            You should give exactly what you want to get in return because you definitely will get exactly what you give.
            <br>
            <br>
            Despite everything happening on the outside pay attention to your inner cat. If it stops purring it means something went wrong. If it still purrs keep going. Be in harmony with yourself.
            <br>
            <br>
            The most important time is right now. You need to feel it with your whole being. It is not an abstract time but this very second. Feel it with your skin, hear it, smell it and let it in your heart.
            <br>
            <br>
            Make a decision in the here and now. Use all the information available including the information you got just a second ago.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before making any decision make sure to weigh the outcome. Will you be happy with it tomorrow? Will you be satisfied with yourself? Will it make your inner cat purr? If the answer is no, maybe you shouldn't do it.
            <br>
            <br>
            Give your inner child the freedom to be happy, enjoy itself, rest, and have fun. 
            <br>
            <br>
            If you are going through something hard, complicated, or scary just ask for help.
            <br>
            <br>
            If something seems like something else, it might be true. Listen to your gut.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you want something, go get it.
            <br>
            <br>
            You deserve everything you wish for. Embrace it with gratitude.
            <br>
            <br>
            Pay attention to people, pay attention to small details in behavior and mood. Look and listen.
            <br>
            <br>
            Give yourself time to think before reacting.
            <br>
            <br>
            Everything is going to be as you want if you are not afraid to have it. 
            <br>
            <br>
